As this is my first Rust project, I'm sure there are many things that can be improved.
If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Installation and Usage
You need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed on your system.

```bash
cargo run

Easy as that!
